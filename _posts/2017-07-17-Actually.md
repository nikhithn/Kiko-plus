## *"Authorization = credentials"*

A fundamental concept in identity and access is the distinction between authentication and authorization.  Authentication is the process by with a user confirms identity -- confirms that the user is the identity that she/he claims to be. Often, this takes the form of supplying valid credentials: username and password.  

Authorization, on the other hand, is verifying that the user has permission or access to particular protected resource.  This is often downstream of authentication; after the identity of the user is confirmed (or is assumed to be anonymous), the user's permissions are compared to the requirements of the protected resource to determine if they should be granted access.  

So then what of the quote in the sub-header, "Authorization = credentials."  This quotation is taken from the [HTTP RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235#section-4.2).  This foundational RFC that establishes the protocol that is the backbone of the internet *completely muddles the distinction between authorization and authentication.*  

Here's another quote from the RFC to establish this further:  

*"The 401 (Unauthorized) status code indicates that the request has not
   been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for
   the target resource."*
   
I like this quote because despite naming the error "Unauthorized," the RFC correctly acknowledges that the credentials are for authentication, proving their own error.  

## Well Actually,

At the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) where I am spending my sabbatical, there is a rule against well actuallies.  Well actuallies, are situations where people make a minor technical correction to a statement that is otherwise correct.  Often the correction in no way advances or contributes to the discussion, and occasionally the correction may even derail the discussion.  

In many ways the correction, I pose above, to modify the HTTP RFC's use of the terms authorization and authentication, is a well actually.  The HTTP RFC has been successfully implemented for 20 years now, since it was published in 1997, so clearly the error did not harm the RFC's purpose.  

But, I still cannot abide.  The distinction is absolutely fundamental --  and for it to be this garbled in use, and for the incorrect usage of these terms to be so widespread...

So I did something about it.  

## Actually

I created a chrome extension that updates occurences of the error "401 - Unauthorized" to read "401 - Unauthenticated," as it should.  Even if this correction is just in my own browser, it is cathartic to see it fixed in at least the domain I control. 

If you share my scruple, you can download the extension on my [github](https://github.com/nikhithn/Actually).  

But this got me wondering.  Surely, this can't be the only error in the RFC, and surely there are other errors floating around the internet, hoping to be fixed.  If you know any, send them to me, and I'll add them to my extension.  

Together, let's make the internet just a little more technically correct.
